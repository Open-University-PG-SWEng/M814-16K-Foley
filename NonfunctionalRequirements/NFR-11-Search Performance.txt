Comments: [M814-ModuleChair] Add comments below, making sure to include your initials in [] at the start.
[Igoris K] Perhaps it would make sense to reword the requirement to change it to "within 2 seconds" and "within 5 seconds" seconds instead of "in 2 seconds" and "in 5 seconds" seconds, otherwise it can be interpreted as a constraint to return no sooner than in 2 or 5 seconds
[JacekSKutyla] I would also suggest replacing word "database" with something which would not be technological biased (it suggests database like MySQL and we do not want to suggest any solutions)
